	        <p>My interest in programming began with a trip to the bookstore one day with my grandmother. While browsing the technology section, I stumbled upon a book titled 'C++ For Dummies'. I had no idea what a programming language was, but I had grown up playing computer games so the code in the book intrigued me. Shortly after convicing my grandmother to buy the book, I was writing my first "Hello World." program in C++. Fast forwarding to the present, I now hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland. I am also currently  pursuing my graduate degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering at Auburn University. In particular, my research interests are Artificial Intelligence, Distrubuted Computing, and Cryptography. I also think the human brain is just as extraordinary as any intelligent machine. Additionally, I find the philosophy of <a href="https://www.humanityplus.org/" class="hyperLinks" alt="humanityplus.org">Transhumanism</a> facinating and would love to someday contribute to the idea of bluring the line between man and machine.</p>
