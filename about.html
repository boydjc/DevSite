	        <p>My interest in computers begain with a trip to the bookstore one day with my grandmother. While browsing the technology section, I stumbled upon a book titled 'C++ For Dummies'. I had no idea what a programming language was, but I had grown up playing games on the computer and the code in the book intrigued me. Shortly after convicing my grandmother to buy the book, I was writing my first "Hello World." program in C++. Fast forwarding to the present, I now hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland. Currently, I am pursuing my graduate degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering at Auburn University. In particular, I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Distrubuted Computing, and cryptography. I find the philosophy of Transhumanism and Humanity+ facinating and would love to someday contribute to the idea of bluring the line between man and machine.</p>
