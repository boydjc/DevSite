		    	My interest in programming began at age 11 with a trip to the bookstore one day with my grandmother. While browsing the technology section, I stumbled upon a book titled 'C++ For Dummies'. I had no idea what a programming language was, but I had grown up playing computer games so the code in the book intrigued me. Shortly after convicing my grandmother to buy the book, I was writing my first "Hello World." program. Fast forwarding to the present, I now hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland. I am also currently pursuing my graduate degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering at Auburn University. In particular, my research interests are Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Computing, and Cryptography.<br><br>Want to collaborate on a project? Need an extra programmer for a particular task? Maybe you just want to say hi? Feel free to reach out and let me know you stopped by!
